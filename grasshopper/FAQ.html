				<h2>What is Grasshopper?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Grasshopper is the best way to learn to code for beginners. With fun, quick lessons on your phone or desktop, Grasshopper teaches adult learners to write real JavaScript. It’s currently available free of charge on Desktop and Android. Grasshopper is a Code with Google program.

				<h2>What can I expect to learn using Grasshopper?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						Grasshopper covers the foundations of JavaScript, how to create animations with code, teaches solving problem techniques needed for technical interviews and introduces how to build a website with HTML and CSS. Here’s what each course covers:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fundamentals - How code works, calling functions, variables, strings, for loops, arrays, conditionals, operators, objects, and how all these things work together.</li>
						<li>Fundamentals II - String and array methods, creating functions, introducing recursion and callbacks, and importing libraries.</li>
						<li>Intro to Interviewing - Decompose and model real world problems so that they can be solved using code, utilizing computational thinking.</li>
						<li>Animations I - Drawing shapes using the popular D3 library, defining functions, callback functions, and animations.</li>
						<li>Animations II - Creating more complex functions using D3 and integrating JavaScript features.</li>
						<li>Array Methods - Using multiple JavaScript array methods, such as indexOf, shift, includes, splice, map and reduce.</li>
						<li>Using a Code Editor - Introduction to a traditional style code editor (or IDE)</li>
						<li>Intro to Webpages - Covers basic HTML and CSS, then uses JavaScript to build an interactive webpage.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						By the end of using Grasshopper’s current curriculum, you should be familiar with core programming concepts, be comfortable solving problems with code and be able to build a simple webpage.

				<h2>What should I do after I use Grasshopper?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					The world is your oyster! Grasshopper should give you the foundational skills you need to continue your journey in learning to code, which can take many different routes. We have users who pursue full time coding bootcamps, part time online coursework, degrees at 4 year universities or community colleges, and more. That said, if you’re looking for a recommendation, we’ve put together some suggested next steps here.

				<h2>Should I expect more lessons? What will it be?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>
						We’re constantly working on expanding our curriculum. In the past couple months, we’ve launched new coursework around technical interviewing (Intro to Interviewing) along with courses for web development (Intro to Webpages) on an entirely new surface (desktop)  We definitely have more work to do and we will continue to prioritize content that is relevant for beginner coders. Since we have an experimental approach to making content to keep our students motivated, we don’t announce new material too far ahead of time, but stay tuned for more!
